# DND-Soundpad
This project is a soundpad which can control sounds local sounds through predefined keyboard shortcuts.
Each sound can be individually controlled, paused, and looped. The main interface is entirely tkinter based with
pygame controlling the audio. This is done because pygame has a really good sound control system while tkinter is easy to setup.
I simply don't have the time to make source images or to really find them.
If you find any or want to help the transition to a pure pygame system just let me know.
